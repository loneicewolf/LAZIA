# The Inner Workings of LAZIA
☣️ This will.. be very **fuzzy** ☣️
game(chess) is used to explain stuff(e.g `checkmate`)
*ig this is a brainstorming file at the moment.*

- diagram
- takebacks to see where did wrong, and test if the other 'branch' was 'correct' as thought from the start.
- gather info on a certain position, e.g if it takes more time to (do something) (calculate/eval,etc) in a certain position:
  - gather data on it! (+ or -?, pieces? can we simplify? )
- time,efficency,verify,
- snapshots,OS,learn from other sources, easy viewable/modifiable/improvable sources
  - human/bot/program/(..)
  - methodologies,checklists,
  - 
- Eval
- Calc
- Material
- Position
- Advantage/Disadvantage/..
- blocks/make most out of each move/
- predict/decoy/vizualise/non random at start(!a bit smart not just random at first*),
- reinforce learn:
  - not just 'don't do this mistake again'(for whatever reason, blunder, inacc,mistake,...,checkmate,or missed checkmate),
  - but also:
    - gather all criterias(eval/calc/pieces/activity/movement/etc, and so on)
    - for both oneself and opponent
    - a
    - a
  - a
- `+`,`-`,`*`
- a

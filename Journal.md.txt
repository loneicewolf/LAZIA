# A Journal.

note, I will because I have to, I must repeat the following:
* read this disclaimer in a both, serious but light hearted tone, it's not meant to be offensive! ❤️

`DISCLAIMER.` This entire idea, repo, project, whatever - is basically just, for me, so it's not meant for others to look or understand it
one might ask why make it public if it's actually just something for myself?
I believe in open source, even if it's something I don't explicitly make for others ^_^ 🌹
so, grammar errors and other wrongs like ( `i` -> `I` and `dont` -> `don't` ), in-consistent-ies (using both `i` and `I`), and so on, will be present.

---

Why I ignore all of this(grammar errors, etc), is for one simple reason:
I want to just focus on what matters :)

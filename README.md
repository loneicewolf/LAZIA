# LAZIA
lazia is a Algorithm for Go, And Chess. It's in it's early days now.
- The goal is to have to be inspired from alpha*zero/go/etc.
Problems, and solutions to these problems will be posted as I go along. Also, this is for myself, but I made it public Since, people maybe like to read about this but, as this is for myself, it wont be so readable for others.
